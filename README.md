# Data Analysis: Improving Service Quality at Nairobi Connect Solutions

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents a diagnostic data analysis for **Nairobi Connect Solutions**, a BPO company facing client attrition due to service quality issues. The goal was to identify the root causes of dissatisfaction and provide a data-driven strategy for improvement.

- **Business Problem:** Decline in client satisfaction leading to contract non-renewals.
- **Objective:** Pinpoint service delivery failures and create an actionable plan to enhance quality and retention.

## 💡 Key Insights & Impact
Analysis of performance metrics revealed a critical bottleneck:

*   **The Data Entry service** was the primary driver of client churn, with a severely slow **Average Response Time of 31.67 minutes** (9x slower than the best-performing team) and a low **Accuracy Rate of 79.85%**. This directly correlated with its critically low **Customer Satisfaction score of 4.98/10**.

## 🚀 Recommendations & Implementation
A phased strategy was developed to address the issues:

1.  **Emergency Intervention for Data Entry:** A 30-day program to re-engineer workflows, targeting a response time <15 mins and accuracy >90%.
2.  **Service Standardization:** Codify and replicate best practices from the top-performing IT Support team across all services.
3.  **Proactive Monitoring:** Implement real-time Power BI dashboards for ongoing performance management.
